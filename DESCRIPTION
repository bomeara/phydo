Title: Creates an Initial Report for a Clade

Description: When first starting to study a group, a student may
    do some basic analyses: make a phylogeny, look to see who else is
    working on the group, gather traits, do comparative analyses. This
    automates all that. This has two advantages: for groups with no one
    studying them, it provides some info.  For groups that are being
    actively studied, this gives a launch into their study.
